SMS-Based OTP notes
The implementation of the SMS-Based OTP was straightforward and relatively quick. By leveraging existing libraries we were able to handle the complexities of sending text messages with not too much overhead, which is good. Means that there is infrastructure to support developers.
The setup process was simple, and the only challenge was integrating the OTP verification properly to ensure smooth user experience. This method benefited from established solutions in the industry, which made development frictionless.
Overall, a success. Tools are there for developers. 


Physical Security Key notes
The implementation of the physical security key model was by far the most intuitive of the three. Using Flask’s session management to simulate the “key” and having a simple button interface for authentication made the setup process remarkably easy. 
NOTE that this would change when an actual key is needed! 
Development of this model felt quick.
Just needed something to test with, less about the development process on this one.

TOTP (QR Code)
The TOTP (QR Code) implementation required slightly more effort due to the need to handle time-sensitive tokens!! 
Again, using libraries allowed us to easily generate and validate one-time passwords, but it took some more work to get this one functional. The integration with QR codes was more work than the past few, but there were still lots of libraries and things, so not too bad. You can do it as a new developer. 
Although the TOTP model is well-documented, it still required some fine-tuning to ensure that the timing and token expiration worked flawlessly, but the presence of established libraries made it a manageable task.

SMS-Based OTP Feedback
Hattie said that the SMS-Based OTP method felt familiar and easy to use. 
Appreciated the quickness of receiving a text message with the code and felt confident in entering it to authenticate. 
When prompted, she said she was aware that text messages can sometimes be intercepted or hacked, but didnt cause her any hesitation or distress. 
She expressed mild annoyance at the fact that SMS-based authentication is still commonly used (not due to security risk, but because of increased login time) help reassure users like her who are concerned about security vulnerabilities.

TOTP (QR Code) Feedback
Hattie found the TOTP (QR code) method a bit more complicated at first, actually I kind of had to step in and explain it to her...
Very frustrated with the 30-second time window for the OTP sometimes made her feel rushed, especially if she didn’t have the app open right when needed. Overall, she felt it was secure, but she noted that a small tutorial or guide explaining the process would be useful for people who might not be as familiar with using authentication apps.

Physical Security Key Feedback
Hattie had a very positive experience with the Physical Security Key method. 
(B/c it's literally just clicking a button to authenticate.) 
She felt reassured by the physical aspect of it, as it seemed more tangible and secure compared to the other methods, when prompted for her thoughts on the matter. However, she did wonder what would happen if she lost the physical key and whether there were backup options for situations like that. 
Overall her favorite method LOL.
